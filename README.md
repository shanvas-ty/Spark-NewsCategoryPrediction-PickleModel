# Spark-NewsCategoryPrediction-PickleModel
Welcome to the Spark-NewsCategoryPrediction-PickleModel repository
A pretrained model in Pickle format is executed in Spark to predict the News category.

         This project is designed to predict the News category.

The purpose of my project is to develop a predictive spark model that can accurately categorize news articles
into different categories. The model is implemented using a pretrained model in Pickle format and executed
in a Spark environment. By utilizing the power of Spark's distributed computing capabilities, we aim to
efficiently process large volumes of news data and provide real-time predictions on the category of news articles.
